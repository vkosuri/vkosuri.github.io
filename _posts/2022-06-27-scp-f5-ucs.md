## About UCS
A user configuration set (UCS) is a backup file that contains BIG-IP configuration data that can be used to fully restore a BIG-IP system in the event of a failure or Return Materials Authorization (RMA) replacement. More information about [UCS]( https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K4423)

The below script uses expect to input the password.

You need to login into F5 BigIP and update the execute permission to expect file ``chmod +x scp_f5_ucs.exp``

## About cron
If you want to execute this script every week place them [F5 cron utility](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K03108954) save below snippet into a file ``scp_ucs_f5.scp.exp`` and place them in this directory ``/etc/cron.weekly``, it will execute **Only once per week, at 04:22 on Sunday**.
